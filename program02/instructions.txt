This directory is for your submission of Programming Assignment #2 (DNA Reversal)

Please note that if working as a pair, only ONE student should submit
the assignment (but both partners should be appropriately credited in
the readme file)

You should be uploading two files within:

(1) The .py file with your source code

(2) A file named readme.txt as described on the course website
    about programming assignments.
