This directory is for your submission of Programming Assignment #7 (Language Helper)

Please note that if working as a pair, only ONE student should submit
the assignment (but both partners should be appropriately credited in
the readme file)

You should be uploading three files within:

(1) A file language_tools.py that defines your LanguageHelper class

(2) A file language_tests.py that is your own enriched set of unit tests

(3) A file named readme.txt as described on the course website
    about programming assignments.
